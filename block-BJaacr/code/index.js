Hint: (Structure of got variable)
  - got variable is an Object which has one key: `houses`
  - `houses` is an array of multiple house
  - Each house is an Object which has two keys: "name" and "people"
  - people is an array of all persons living in that particular house
  - And, each person is an object with "name" and "description" properties
